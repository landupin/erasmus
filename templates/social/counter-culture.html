                  The counterculture of the 1960s refers to an anti-establishment cultural phenomenon that was
                  first developed in the US as a response to old religious and social standards of previous
                  generations. They opened questions about sexuality, women´s rights, respecting authorities and
                  experimenting with drugs, by this behavior the movement protested also against war in Vietnam
                  and war in general.

      The counterculture era has expanded after assassination of John F. Kennedy in November
      1963. After US joined military conflict in Southest Asia and with the resignation of President
      R. Nixon, it became absorbed into the popular culture.

      <span class="font-weight-bold">Counterculture in the US</span><br>
      Many social issues fueled the growth of the larger counterculture movement. One was a
      nonviolent movement in the United States seeking to resolve constitutional civil rights illegalities,
      especially regarding general racial segregation, longstanding disfranchisement of blacks in the
      South by white-dominated state government, and ongoing racial discrimination in jobs, housing,
      and access to public places in both the North and the South.

      Beat movement, also called Beat Generation, American social and literary movement
      originating in the 1950s and centred in the bohemian artist communities of San Francisco’s
      North Beach, Los Angeles’ Venice West, and New York City’s Greenwich Village. Its
      adherents, self-styled as “beat” (originally meaning “weary,” but later also connoting a
      musical sense, a “beatific” spirituality, and other meanings) and derisively called “beatniks,”
      expressed their alienation from conventional, or “square,” society by adopting an almost
      uniform style of seedy dress, manners, and “hip” vocabulary borrowed from jazz musicians.
      Generally apolitical and indifferent to social problems, they advocated personal release,
      purification, and illumination through the heightened sensory awareness that might be
      induced by drugs, jazz, sex, or the disciplines of Zen Buddhism. Apologists for the Beats,
      among them Paul Goodman, found the joylessness and purposelessness of modern society
      sufficient justification for both withdrawal and protest.<br>
      
      Beat poets sought to liberate poetry from academic preciosity and bring it “back to the
      streets.” They read their poetry, sometimes to the accompaniment of progressive jazz, in
      such Beat strongholds as the Coexistence Bagel Shop and Lawrence Ferlinghetti’s City
      Lights bookstore in San Francisco. The verse was frequently chaotic and liberally sprinkled
      with obscenities but was sometimes, as in the case of Allen Ginsberg’s Howl (1956),
      ruggedly powerful and moving. Ginsberg and other major figures of the movement, such as
      the novelist Jack Kerouac, advocated a kind of free, unstructured composition in which the
      writer put down his thoughts and feelings without plan or revision—to convey the immediacy
      of experience—an approach that led to the production of much undisciplined and incoherent
      verbiage on the part of their imitators. By about 1960, when the faddish notoriety of the
      movement had begun to fade, it had produced a number of interesting and promising writers,
      including Ferlinghetti, Gregory Corso, Philip Whalen, and Gary Snyder, and had paved the
      way for acceptance of other unorthodox and previously ignored writers, such as the Black
      Mountain poets and the novelist William Burroughs.

      Alienated by what they saw as the conventionality and materialism of 1950s society, a
      loosely knit group of American writers known as the beat generation began a social and
      literary movement in New York City’s Greenwich Village and San Francisco’s North Beach.<br>
      Coined by Jack Kerouac, one of the movement’s foremost voices, the term beat signified
      &quot;beaten down&quot; or &quot;weary&quot; but also came to connote a &quot;beatific&quot; spirituality that adherents
      sought. Antiestablishment and antiliterary, the beats were also apolitical. Instead of urging
      social change, they advocated personal enlightenment through the heightened state of mind
      resulting from jazz, sex, hallucinogenic drugs, and Zen Buddhism. Although no political
      revolutions arose from the beat movement, a literary revolution did-the unconventional style
      and subject matter of the beat writers amounted to a new aesthetic in American literature.<br>
