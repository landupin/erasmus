        <p class="mb-0">“The Vietnam War was a long, costly and divisive conflict that pitted the communist government
            of North Vietnam against South Vietnam and its principal ally, the United States. The conflict was
            intensified by the ongoing Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. More than 3 million
            people (including over 58,000 Americans) were killed in the Vietnam War, and more than half of the dead were
            Vietnamese civilians. Opposition to the war in the United States bitterly divided Americans, even after
            President Richard Nixon ordered the withdrawal of U.S. forces in 1973. Communist forces ended the war by
            seizing control of South Vietnam in 1975, and the country was unified as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam
            the following year.”</p>
