                        <p>The year 1968 is registered in the history of Czechoslovakia as an attempt to establish
                            socialism with a human face, which meant an effort to democratize the communist system.
                            Alexander Dubcek, who was elected as First Secretary of the Central Committee, promoted the
                            removal of censorship, freedom of travel, authorization of non-communist societies, efforts
                            to liberate Czechs and Slovaks, and improving the situation of churches. With his human
                            approach, Dubcek gradually gained the sympathy and support of the people. However the Soviet
                            Union looked critically at events in Czechoslovakia. The Soviets addressed several warnings
                            to the Czechoslovak authorities during the year 1968 to changes in the internal political
                            line. As the Czechoslovak leadership did not do so, they decided to overthrow the
                            development by military action. The occupation began on the night of August 20, 1968.
                            Despite the denial of armed resistance of the Communist leadership, unarmed people in many
                            places spontaneously confronted Soviet tanks. Soldiers responded by firing into groups of
                            protestors in several cities, which resulted in many casualties. The occupation stopped the
                            process of democratization and slowly a period of normalization that abolished all the
                            achievements of socialism with the human face began.</p>

                        <p>On February 23th, 1981, there was a military coup d’Etat. Lieutenant Colonel Tejero, with 200
                            armed soldiers, entered the Congreso de los Diputados during the election of the new
                            President of the Government. The outgoing President, Adolfo Suárez and one of his ministers
                            tried to defend democracy against this attack. After being informed, the king Juan Carlos
                            addressed the Spanish people on TV, supporting the Constitution. His firm defense of
                            democracy helped to put an end to the coup.</p>

                            measures, Spain joined the European Economic Community, later to become the European Union.
                            In this way, we became a more modern and richer country. Since 2002 we have been part of the
                            euro-zone.</p>

                            world events, like the World Exposition in Seville, the European Culture capital for Madrid
                            (with the opening of the Thyssen museum), and, above all, the huge success of the Olympic
                            Games in Barcelona. All these events showed to the world that Spain was a modern and
                            prosperous country, helping to overcome stereotypes from other times.</p>

                            decreased, and after losing political influence in Euskadi, in 2011 ETA put an end to their
