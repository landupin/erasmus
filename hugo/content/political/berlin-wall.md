skimmer: "After World War II the conditions were so bad, more and more people fled to the West. To prevent them from running away, the GDR built a wall in 1961,  ironically named “antifascist bulwark”. Soldiers had the order to kill anyone who tried to cross the border. In 1989 the border opened and one year later the reunification of both Germanies was celebrated."

### After the war:

After World War II Germany was divided into four occupation zones. There was a joint British, French and an American zone in the west and a Soviet zone in the east. In 1949 the western occupation zones were merged into the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). In the same year the USSR founded the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in the east of Germany.

In the western part of Germany there was a great development during the 1950s and 1960s known as &quot;Wirtschaftswunder&quot; (economic miracle). One reason for this development was the Marshall plan, which was an American initiative to rebuild Western Europe after the war. The GRD on the other hand was in a bad condition. After the occupation by the Soviet Union all businesses were taken over by the socialist system and most of them were closed. So, a lot of eastern Germans fled to the west to find better opportunities.

## Warsaw Pact of 1955:

In 1955 the eight nations, who were under control of the Soviet Union, signed the Warsaw Pact. Formally this pact was about the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance but the real aim of this alliance was to make sure that these countries would stay under the leadership of communism. If needed the USSR would be ready to send troops to suppress protestors such as in Eastern Germany in 1953.

## Uprising of 1953:

On June 17th, 1953 more than 40 000 citizens of the GRD protested against the socialist system. The government suppressed the protesters with the help of Soviet tanks and the next day the ruling SED-party published an article in which they claimed that the protest was the direct result of the attempts by "western agencies" to disrupt the national stability.

### The Wall:

The leader of the GRD, Walter Ulbricht, wanted to keep the population inside his country. So, in 1961 eastern construction workers, under the supervision of the border police, started to build a wall inside the capital of Berlin and a 136 km-long fence between the two Germanies. The border soldiers had the order to kill everyone, who tried to pass the border illegally. In the time from 1961 to 1989 over 136 people were shot during an escape attempt. Only old people, who were not able to work anymore, could visit or go to the west.

The Communist government of the GDR first began to build a barbed wire wall, then a concrete wall “Antifaschistischer Schutzwall,” or “antifascist bulwark,” between East and West Berlin. The official purpose of this Berlin Wall was to keep Western “fascists” from entering East Germany and undermining the socialist state, but it primarily served the objective of stemming mass defections (escapes) from East to West. The first victim of the wall was a woman, Ida Siekmann. Nine days after the Wall was built she jumped out of her apartment, because the front door of her tenement was barricaded, as the house belonged to the East and the street and the sidewalk to the West. The first victim who was shot was Günter Litfin when he tried to cross the bulwark in 1961. After that Russians started to manoeuvre against the West to get the Americans, the British and French out of the city.

## Ultimatum of 1958:

In 1958 the Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev demanded the Western powers to pull their forces out of West Berlin. He gave them an ultimatum of 6 months. The Western powers did not accept this ultimatum and reinforced the border with tanks. At the border crossing Western tanks faced eastern tanks. One single shot could have started a nuclear war.

## Prague Spring of 1968:

The Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia, Alexander Dubcek, made the attempt to reform the political system of his country. He wanted to create a socialist system "with a human face". On August 21st, 1968 the USSR reacted by invading Czechoslovakia. They restored the old order.

## Warsaw Genuflection of 1970:

During a visit in Warsaw on December 7th, 1970 the German chancellor Willy Brandt knelt down in front of a monument to the victims of the Nazi regime. This gesture of humanity and the German acceptance of Poland‘s new borders improved the relationship between these two nations.

## Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev:

Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev was the eight and the last leader of the Soviet Union from 1985 to 1991. Gorbachev reformed the USSR with his Perestroika ("restructuring") and his Glasnost ("publicity"). Amongst other aspects he brought the freedom of media and reconciliation with the USA under George H. W. Bush. In the GDR Gorbachev`s policy was seen as a call for reforms. This enabled the resolution or end of the USSR and of other Warsaw Pact nations.

### Reunification:

The Berlin Wall stood until November 9, 1989, when the head of the East German Communist Party announced that citizens of the GDR could cross the border whenever they pleased. That night, ecstatic crowds swarmed the wall. Some crossed freely into West Berlin, while others brought hammers and picks and began to chip away at the wall itself. To this day, the Berlin Wall remains one of the most powerful and enduring symbols of the Cold War.

It was in November 1989, when the idea arose for a promising future for millions of people in the countries of the Eastern Block. In the middle of the decade in 1980, The Soviet Union started a few reforms in exterior politics that allowed citizens of these countries to decide on their own political future.

When Communism fell in Hungary in 1989, the electric fence between the country and Austria was removed. It was the first step for the fall of the “Iron Curtain”, as it caused massive demonstrations on Alexanderplatz/Berlin. On November 9th, 1989, East Germany’s government opened all the checkpoints.

Crowd of Berliners were assembled in the stands of border control of Berlin. The guards had orders of letting nobody pass, but finally they gave in to the masses. This day, euphoria and moments of joy and extreme happiness were experienced by the German nation.

On the same day thousands of East Germans gathered at the Berlin Wall to cross to the other side and they were not stopped, so there was a huge exodus.

The next day, people started to chip away at and finally knock down the Berlin Wall.

Once the borders were reopened, family members and friends who had been separated for 28 years finally came together.

To this day, the Berlin Wall remains one of the most powerful and enduring symbols of the Cold War.

One year later on October 3rd, 1990 the GDR became a part of the FRG, called reunification. This is considered as the end of the Cold War, because it could only happen with the agreement of all four victorious powers of World War II. Since then the Germans have been celebrating this day of unity as their national holiday.

- ["The building of the Berlin Wall, which began on August 13th , 1961, gave a stark architectural face to the Cold War and spawned a slew of spy movies located on the fault line of East-West intrigue. Hollywood masters like Billy Wilder and Alfred Hitchcock were among the first to spin political fables in this divided city. But in the ’80s and beyond, as Soviet ideology cracked along with its most notorious edifice, German filmmakers addressed their own fissured history."](http://entertainment.time.com/2011/08/11/top-10-berlin-wall-movies/slide/introduction/)
