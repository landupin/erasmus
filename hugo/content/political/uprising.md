This led to a lack of human rights and freedom for citizens. Those who refused to support the regime were often imprisoned or given sanctions. The era of communism ended after several uprisings and demonstrations throughout Eastern Europe in the late 1980’s."

###Uprisings in Czechoslovakia

In the first election (May 26, 1946) the Communist party won and achieved the majority in parliament. Moreover, they also completely controlled the police. In protest most non-communist politicians resigned including president Beneš (February 20, 1948), Gottwald took his place. In 1949 he had imposed the death penalty on impartials in connection with the preparation of the May anti-communist uprising.



The 1960s was a period of liberalization. Alexander Dubček became the first secretary of the communist party in Czechoslovakia (1968), he started to practise socialism “with the human face” (with a more relaxed approach). The Prague Spring was a period of liberalization, meetings of writers and a demonstrations of university students. However, the Soviet Union did not like these liberalizations. As a reaction,  the protesting students were beaten not only in the streets, but also in their dormitory buildings. On top of this, on 21st August 1968, the Soviet Union and other members of the Warsaw Pact invaded the country to halt the reforms.

For the first few months, there was a lot of aversion and hostility, however for the following months, people became discouraged and opposed less as a result.



In the 1980s the socio-political decline from the 70s was continuing to show. It culminated with the Velvet Revolution. These were the bloodless events which helped to remove the Communist regime in Czechoslovakia. The initiators of this were students, as well as some actors and other well-known people. Two major movements were formed, Public Against Violence in Slovakia,  and Civic Forum in Czechia. After the police brutality on students the public protested by organising walkouts. On 27th November 1989 there was a large protest and in early December, after the resignation of communists, a new state government was created.
