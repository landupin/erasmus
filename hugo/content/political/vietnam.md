          to expand their communist ideology and were supported by the Soviet Union and China. However, due to
          USAs Communism Containment Policy, South Vietnam received American much support, but in 1975 America
          withdrew all troops as defeat was inevitable."

The Vietnam War was a long, costly and divisive conflict that pitted the communist government of North Vietnam against South Vietnam and its principal ally, the United States. The conflict was intensified by the ongoing Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. More than 3 million people (including over 58,000 Americans) were killed in the Vietnam War, and more than half of the dead were Vietnamese civilians. Opposition to the war in the United States bitterly divided Americans, even after President Richard Nixon ordered the withdrawal of U.S. forces in 1973. Communist forces ended the war by seizing control of South Vietnam in 1975, and the country was unified as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam the following year.

The Vietnam War was the result of the first Indochina war, which is the reason why it is also called the second Indochina war. It was a conflict between the NLF (National Liberty Front/ Viet Cong), North Vietnam which were supported by China and the Soviet Union and South Vietnam, with its confederate, the USA.

In  the end the Viet Cong and North Vietnam won, which led to the USA ending support for South Vietnam and the reason why Vietnam is one country today.

“The United States fought in the Vietnam War from 1964 to 1973. Vietnam was a divided country, similar to Korea. There were communists and non-communists. The United States wanted to help unite Vietnam and not have a communist government. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy, convinced that Communist China was actively supporting North Vietnam, approved a US military campaign in Vietnam to help the nationalist government stave off the Communist rebellion. Instead of supporting the troops in Vietnam the citizens of America were protesting against this war.

The Vietnam War was a very long war. Many people died in the war. The Vietnam War divided many areas of the United States. Some Americans did not want the United States to fight in Vietnam. At the end of the war, the United States lost. Vietnam became a communist government.

National Liberation Front, or the Viet Cong, was a large political organisation in South Vietnam. It supported Ho Chi Minh and the North Vietnamese by fighting the Americans and the South Vietnamese from within South Vietnam. It comprised both Guerrilla and regular army units and ultimately aimed to install communism in Vietnam. They are most infamous for the Tet Offensive, this was a military offensive in January and February 1968 when Viet Cong members entered cities disguised amongst civilians heading home for "Tet", a Vietnamese holiday, during which American and South Vietnamese troops expected a seven-day truce to be observed. Some 80,000 Viet Cong attacked over 100 towns, with orders to "crack the sky" and "shake the earth". Despite their best efforts, however, the Tet Offensive proved to be a decisive failure for the Viet Cong; around 40,000 communists had been killed compared to just 10,000 US and South Vietnamese. 

The Viet Cong Communist rebels, supported by the North Vietnamese Army, were supplied along the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which consisted of a network of paths, tunnels and bunkers that the Americans tried in vain to destroy. This only led the USSR and China to intensify their assistance to the Communist National Liberation Front (NLF), which they supplied with arms and food; however, they did not intervene directly. In February 1965, the United States began bombing military and industrial targets in North Vietnam. The US Army used helicopters, modern weapons like controlled rockets, machine guns and a special type of chemical weapons for example "Agent Orange". This was followed by a protracted guerrilla war, despite some fruitless attempts at international mediation.

Many Americans were opposed to the Vietnam War. There were many reasons for this; firstly, the draft threatened blue-collar working-class Americans far more than it affected richer US citizens. In addition, there were many people with moral objections to the Vietnam War, particularly college students. Civilian casualties were massively downplayed in the Western media and when photographic evidence surfaced, such as the infamous photo of General Nguyen Ngoc Loan shooting an alleged terrorist, it caused mass public outcry. As well as this, the perception that US intervention in Vietnam was not legally justifiable was an argument made by some. They believed that the domino theory had simply been used as an excuse to mask American imperial intentions (the desire to extend the power of one's country through colonization or military force). War Crimes were also horrifically abundant during the Vietnam War. Massacres of civilians, bombing of civilian targets, terrorism and the wide use of torture were committed by both sides, these crimes are one of the biggest reasons why the Vietnam War is so controversial to this day.

The United States involvement in the Vietnam war was phased out through a process known as Vietnamization. This Nixon-administration policy aimed to "expand, equip, and train South Vietnamese forces and assign them to an ever-increasing combat role, at the same time steadily reducing the number of U.S. combat troops." According to US president Richard Nixon there were two components to Vietnamization: The first was "strengthening the armed force of the South Vietnamese in numbers, equipment, leadership and combat skills", and the second was "the extension of the pacification program [i.e. military aid to civilians] in South Vietnam." By the beginning of 1972, over 400,000 US personnel had been withdrawn from Vietnam. The fall of Saigon in 1975 resulted in its mass evacuation by the last of the US personnel still in Vietnam in an operation known as "Frequent Wind", following this, the US president Gerald Ford gave a televised speech declaring an end to the Vietnam War and all US involvement in Vietnam. 

The resultant effects of the Vietnam War were felt throughout the world. After a North Vietnamese victory over the South Vietnamese on 2 July 1976, North and South Vietnam were merged to form the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Around 300,000 of the conquered South Vietnamese were sent to "re-education" camps, where many endured torture, starvation and disease while being forced to perform hard labour. In addition, around 3 million people left Vietnam and the surrounding countries of Laos and Cambodia in what is known as the "Indochina refugee crisis", many Asian countries were unwilling to accept them, and a great deal settled in countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia and France. Since many of these refugees were "intellectuals, technicians and officials" this caused significant issues for Indo-Chinese countries.
