skimmer: "Religion played a big role in the Cold War. In the Communist states, churches became the last places where you were allowed to gather and the only free spaces for free communication and thinking. Many religions were suppressed; religious people were often persecuted, put in jail and tortured."

The fact that religion played a significant role in the Cold War might seem self-evident, given the atheistic nature of communism and the powerful influence of Christianity on the lives of millions of people on both sides of the Iron Curtain - no doubt that the governments of communist countries saw Christianity as a threat and responded accordingly. 
After World War II, the Catholic Church, aided by the CIA, persuaded the Italian electorate to vote for anti-communist parties, thus preventing the most popular party, the communist, from taking the power in Italy. If Italy had became a Communist party, the future of Europe might have been very different.
As for the Eastern bloc, citizens who openly showed interest in their Christian faith often jeopardised their educational or employment opportunities, and were victims to religious persecution. However, without Christianity, the Cold War might not have ended peacefully. Under totalitarian rule, churches and other religious organisations brought workers, students, and intellectuals together and church services and religious festivals were the only legal occasions for resistance and freedom, and also a safe haven for persecuted people.
Religion was also an excuse for the Americans to hate the Soviets even more. The Americans claimed that God was on their side, and they called the Soviets ‘godless atheists’. The Soviets condemned religion - after all, Karl Marx, the founder of the Communist ideology claimed that religion was the ‘opiate of the masses’.
There are some key examples of the importance of faith when resisting communism. In Poland, the opposition frequently gathered during Catholic liturgies and celebrations. Pope John Paul II, who was Polish himself, supported them when he travelled to Gniezno (the birthplace of Polish Christianity), on June 3rd 1979 to speak to the churches throughout Communist Europe and Christians in the Soviet bloc. He was also a key factor in bringing about freedom in Poland alongside with the Solidarity trade union. This inspired similar events in other Communist countries.

The famous Monday demonstrations in Leipzig, city in the former GDR (German Democratic Republic or East Germany) took place after prayers for peace at St Nikolai Church. Protesters gathered around this church in 1989; eventually these protests contributed to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Communist regime.
Meanwhile, in Spain religion was part of the national identity. Before the Cold War, a Civil War took place in Spain (1936 - 1939). It started because general Franco set up a coup d’etat against the Second Spanish Republic government. In this war, religious people were killed or imprisoned by the Republican side. There were also a lot of religious buildings, paintings etc. that were destroyed during the war.
When the Civil War finished, the Catholic religion supported Franco’s dictatorship. His regime was called national and catholic. There were a lot of religious people from movements like Opus Dei who were ministers in the Spanish Government. However, in the 60’s, some religious people started to show their opposition to  Franco’s  dictatorship. There was even a prison only for religious people. 
Today, in Spain you can practice whatever religion you want, because freedom of religion is guaranteed by the 1978´s Constitution.
