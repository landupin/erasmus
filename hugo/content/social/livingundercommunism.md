skimmer: "These cruel times occurred right after the Second World War and gradually spread into the countries which were controlled by USSR. It immediately affected people's lives in many ways such as economic, cultural or religious. However, the worst thing of this regime was the lack of freedom in everyday life."

### Life Under Communism in East Germany

Children brought up in non-communist families were not given the right to the education that children following
the regime were given. Socialized children at home were expected to never attempt to rise to any position due to
this.
When trying to leave the GRD, a ransom would have to had been paid for each person. This was because the
regime required money to buy better surveillance equipment.
Telephone calls, letters and any other forms of long-distance communication were always being monitored by
the GRD.
Surveillance was everywhere in East Germany during the Cold War and citizens were often forced to live two
different lifestyles. What they said and did at home was one thing, but they had to be careful when speaking
publicly at school or work.
Despite essentials for life being cheap (i.e. bread, water), salaries were low and many things we take for granted
today were seen as luxuries due to being insanely expensive.
Unemployment was almost non-existent as work was found for every man and woman in East Germany.
As soon as the regime had collapsed, many requested Stasi files to see what the government had picked up on
whilst spying on citizens.
Many citizens were very much isolated from Western culture, for example, many children may have grown up
not knowing what a Barbie doll was.

### Life Under Communism in Czechoslovakia
The state was controlling the economy which was working very poorly, as basic citizen supplies were often not
found.
Many foods such as coconuts and mandarins were seen as luxuries, and therefore were only present at times like
Christmas.

Criticizing the state of course meant that you would be disadvantaged by the state in many ways. Children could
be unaccepted into universities, companies could decide not to offer people jobs, and so on.
There were thousands of police members working undercover to listen in on conversations in daily life and were
often found to be random people payed to report any news to government officials.
Not being employed at the time was a crime. Work was found for everyone of all classes and there was no
unemployment.
Of course, living in a communist country, everyone worked for the government in some way or another.
Life was very similar to that of the control in East Germany, however, it can be noted that surveillance and
boarder control was less prominent in Czechoslovakia.

- [The nature of the regimes required outward agreement and loyalty from their citizens, so those who wanted to live without trouble from the state had to create and maintain a stark divide between their public lives, in which they displayed obedience and deference to the governmentÂ´s demands, and their private lives, where they could speak more freely.](https://www.socialismrealised.eu/catalogue/what-we-dont-talk-about/)
- [While many talked openly at home about political and social issues, in public it was necessary to use official and conformist language. This was not only the case in the world of adultsht, but also in that of children, who at school in particular were confronted with the official, propaganda-defined version of reality](https://www.socialismrealised.eu/catalogue/back-to-the-past/)
- [Invasion of privacy was one of the repressive strategies of the State Security apparatus. Extortion and pressure via family members was sometimes more effective than directly persecuting the opponents of the regime. Police harrassment was hard to bear without familial trust and strong emotional ties.](https://www.socialismrealised.eu/catalogue/invasion-of-privacy/)
