The political ideologies of both the Eastern and the Western spheres were reflected in all of these areas (elements?). Whereas Eastern popular culture often had to conform to the politics of the state, Western popular culture was much more anti-authoritarian and often condemned Soviet beliefs and doctrine."

Culture in the Eastern spheres of Europe was often under strict governmental control. Pro-communist ideals were encouraged and anti-communist ideals were suppressed. This divide was most evident in Soviet-sphere music. In the USSR for example, the government encouraged the population to listen to traditional Russian Folk music, such as the song Katuschka which was covered by several different artists in many different languages. It eventually became one of the most famous communist partisan anthems along with “Bella Ciao”.
Films, such as The Blue Bird were also distinctly anti-capitalist. This 1970 animated movie was critical of modern capitalism, as well as portraying a rich man as the warmongering antagonist it set several scenes in a modern, and oppressive, capitalist city, causing the film to serve as a subtle but potent piece of propaganda.

Western Musicians were also affected by the shadow of the Cold War. Whereas the East allowed little artistic freedom the artists in the West often criticized the Cold War as well as their own government’s involvement, such as Paul Hardcastle’s “19” which criticized the Vietnam War. Anti-Establishment views also emerged in the form of counter-culture. Famous artists, such as Bob Dylan, also sang about the Cold War. His famous songs, “Blowin’ in the Wind”, “Masters of War”, and “A Hard rain’s a-Gonna fall” Other famous examples of cold war music are:

Films were released throughout the Cold War and reinforced the East-West divide.

Star Trek, a famous sci-fi television series, is about a free and democratic alliance, called the “Federation”. Our heroes (the crew of the starship enterprise), can be thought of as representing the Western powers, whereas the Klingons – their arch-rivals –can be seen to represent the communist East. In the episode “Errand of Mercy” the Klingons are portrayed as being manipulative and deceitful as well as hungry for war. These traits were intended to be a reflection on the US’s perceptions of Russian culture.
