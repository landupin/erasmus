The Cold War is often considered the golden age of espionage, a time when
the United States and Soviet Union, used all available tools to uncover each other’s secrets by
operating with great secrecy and living double lives so they can infiltrate enemy governments. They
certainly spent large amounts of money recruiting, training and outfitting spies and agents. The
purpose of espionage was to collect information about the enemy, their army and technical abilities,
their actions and intentions.
