skimmer: "During the Cold War, nations used sports to promote their political, social, and economic development. Between the end of World War II and the collapse of Communism, “Cold War sport” went beyond the bipolar USA-USSR rivalry to also include Africa, Asia, and Latin America. With success and failure measured every four years at the Olympic Games, sport assumed more significance during the Cold War than at any other time in its history."

###The Chess Championships of 1972

A notable occasion in the history of Cold War sports were the momentous Chess Championships of 1972.
This event was a perfect example of the superpower rivalry, and has even been referred to as the ‘Match of
the Century’. Sports during the Cold War were not only a test of strength, but of mind, and chess was the
ultimate test of intelligence. What was especially interesting about these championships was the match
between the USA and USSR, or more specifically, between challenger Bobby Fischer, and defending
champion Boris Spassky. The fact that Spassky, who was a three-year champion, was defeated by a
representative of the USA really built a further sense of rivalry between the two nations, because the Soviet
Nation had always thought of chess as a display of the intellectual superiority of the Soviets, and to be
overcome by the opposing nation was certainly a harsh blow.

###Miracle on Ice

Miracle On Ice was the match between the teams of the USSR and the USA at the 1980 Winter Olympics.
The fact that this match was not, indeed, a final, emphasises the rivalry between the two superpowers, as
the match was a major media event nonetheless, despite the countries having to play further matches
against other teams in order to actually secure medals. The reason that this match was deemed so
significant was probably due to the fact that the fragile peace between the two nations had been stretched

following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. The USA emerged victorious from the match, which
served as a major morale booster for citizens of the USA.

###Summer 1980 Moscow Olympics

The Moscow Olympics saw the sparsest participation since 1956, with a total of only 80 countries taking
part. This was due to the USA’s decision to boycott these Olympics. The USA, being a superpower, was
able to place pressure on its allies to follow suit, and thus, many countries refrained from participating.
Quite a few of these allies protested at first, though, arguing that the boycott was both strategically and
emotionally pointless, but soon acquiesced to the USA’s demands. Some Western countries like Britain,
France and Italy chose not to completely boycott the games, but sent reduced numbers of athletes.
The organisers had hoped that these Olympics would help stabilise the fragile peace, but the outcome of
the lack of participation instead meant that rivalry and mistrust between opposing nations were as strong as
ever. This building tension then contributed to the next boycott of the Summer 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.

###Boycott of 1984

In May 1984, the year in which the next Olympics following the USA’s boycott of Moscow’s Olympics, were
to be held, the Soviet Union turned the tables on the USA, issuing a statement that expressed their
intention to boycott the games. The reasons cited in this statement included, ‘anti-Soviet hysteria’ and
‘chauvinistic sentiments’. The Soviet chairman of the time (Konstantin Chernenko) further claimed that they
did not trust that the Soviet athletes would have adequate security. The Soviet Union, like the USA,
pressurised its allies to boycott the games, and as a result, the only country in attendance at these
Olympics with ideological links to the Soviet Union was Romania. The Soviet Union took another further
step, and hosted its own games, entitled ‘the Friendship Games’, which were carried out from July to
September 1984 in several countries under the influence of the Communists. Most of the participating
countries had boycotted the US Olympics, but the USSR still insisted that the competition was about the
promotion of peace and friendship between nations (hence its name). Some western states, such as Italy
and West Germany, took part in both games.
