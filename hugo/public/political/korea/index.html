    <p>On 25th June 1950, the Korean War started as a result of many soldiers from the North and South crossing the border. The fear of communism taking over the world forced America to intervene, this was the first military action taken during the Cold War. It was only ended in an armistice on 27th July 1953.</p>

    <p>Korea passed through a difficult situation between 1945 to 1949: two places were separated by the 38th parallel and then were occupied, the north by the Soviets and the south by the north Americans. With the confidence of having a USSR backrest and with the armed support of Mao Zedong, the Chinese leader, the North Korean communist Kim Il Sung, attacked the south area directed by the nationalist Syngman Rhee and he seized Seoul in 1950. Taking advantage of the absenteeism of USSR, in the Security Council, the Americans got an international mandate to take part of it, with the purpose of restoring the peace in Korea. The general MacArthur organised a landing in Incheon, hoping to get the total victory. However, his offence in Yalu River, through the Chinese border, caused the intervention of Mao´s troops that defeated the United Nations force. MacArthur looked at the possibility of use of the nuclear weapons to defeat China. Contrary to adopting these measures, Truman, president of the USA, dismissed him in 1951, although in the USA he was received like a popular hero who had tried to reunify Korea. The conflict got into a dead point and the negotiations started in Kaesong went until the armistice in 1953: the cease-fire line moved to the north of the 38th parallel. ( Panmunjom Peace).</p>

<p>North Korea: They had mining and industrial wealth.
South Korea: They had  more agrarian resources and goods commercial ports.
Armistice: Agreement which is signed by two or more countries when they decide to stop fighting during some time with the final purpose to discuss a possible peace. Pablo Picasso: He made a picture called “Masacre en Corea”, Massacre in Korea, based on the famous Goya´s painting “3 de mayo”, 3rd may.</p>

<p>Nowadays the armistice continues to rule the “peace” between these countries, although the tension can break the work of 64 years.</p>

<h3 id="curiosities-about-the-korean-war">Curiosities About The Korean War</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>This war was the official beginning of the Cold War between the USA and the USSR.</p></li>

<li><p>The Incheon landing in 1950 is considered one of the best military strategies of the 20th centurybecause it cut the North Korean offensive.</p></li>

<li><p>Sixteen countries around the world participated in this conflict</p></li>

<li><p>The same armament was used than in the Second World War.</p></li>

<li><p>Korea proposed that white and black soldiers should battle together, without segregation.</p></li>

<li><p>The leader of the UN in charge of the operations was the famous Second World War commander Douglas MacArthur.</p></li>

<li><p>He was destitute of his position after affirming that the only solution to the conflict was an atomic bombardment over China.</p></li>

<li><p>During the winter, the Chinese troops wore such thick coats that the gun cartridges and carabiners sometimes didn&#39;t have contact with the body.</p></li>

<li><p>This is one of the first conflicts after the Second World War where the helicopter was used to transport injured people.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="war-on-land-and-sea">War on land and sea</h3>

<p>The paratroopers from the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team (better known as the Rakkans), carried out all the operations taking place in the air during the Korean War, fighting on a total of six conflicts. Today they belong to the 101st Air-bone Division (Air Assault)</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Incheon War (1950) was an invasion through the Yellow Sea. It was the biggest victory of the USA army and the Americans turned the tables on what was previously considered a lost war. Also, the Korea war was the first one in which jet planes were used.</p>

<h3 id="korean-war-and-the-atomic-bomb">Korean war and the atomic bomb</h3>

<p>In 1950, it was only five years after the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. So, at that moment, many people thought that this weapon could be very important in this conflict. The USA warned China that, if their troops were sent to Korea, they would throw the nuclear bomb on them, but China ignored this threat.</p>

<p>Moreover, they threatened the USSR, but the Europeans opposed because the Soviets could use this argument to invade Europe. Finally, the Americans said that they would only use that weapon to</p>

<p>prevent &ldquo;a bigger military disaster&rdquo;.

<h3 id="espionage-during-korean-war">Espionage during Korean War</h3>

<p>After the USA had improved their espionage and cryptanalysis abilities, Russians duplicated them. In fact, during the famous Black Friday, the Soviets activated one new network of communications and methodology of encryption. The messages were sent by radio cutting off any emission. In response, the Defence Secretary of the USA ordered the creation of a new agency called AFSA, even though it wasn&#39;t too much effective against the Soviets. It was the key in the Korean War because it intercepted many messages. The North Koreans revealed all their attack techniques through those mechanisms.</p>

<p>U.S. President   Donald Trump  met with  North Korean Supreme Leader   Kim Jong-un  on June 12,
2018, in  Singapore , in the first  summit meeting  between the leaders of the  United States of
America  and the  Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea  (North Korea). They signed a joint
statement, agreeing to security guarantees for North Korea, new peaceful relations, reaffirmation
of the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, recovery of soldiers&rsquo; remains, and follow-up
negotiations between high-level officials. Immediately following the summit, Trump announced
that the US would discontinue &quot;provocative&quot; joint military exercises with South Korea and would
