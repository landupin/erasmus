    <p>After  World War II countries including Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia were occupied by USSR, which was considered the “mother” of communism. This led to a lack of human rights and freedom for citizens. Those who refused to support the regime were often imprisoned or given sanctions. The era of communism ended after several uprisings and demonstrations throughout Eastern Europe in the late 1980’s.</p>

<p>In the first election (May 26, 1946) the Communist party won and achieved the majority in parliament. Moreover, they also completely controlled the police. In protest most non-communist politicians resigned including president Beneš (February 20, 1948), Gottwald took his place. In 1949 he had imposed the death penalty on impartials in connection with the preparation of the May anti-communist uprising.</p>

<p>The 1960s was a period of liberalization. Alexander Dubček became the first secretary of the communist party in Czechoslovakia (1968), he started to practise socialism “with the human face” (with a more relaxed approach). The Prague Spring was a period of liberalization, meetings of writers and a demonstrations of university students. However, the Soviet Union did not like these liberalizations. As a reaction,  the protesting students were beaten not only in the streets, but also in their dormitory buildings. On top of this, on 21st August 1968, the Soviet Union and other members of the Warsaw Pact invaded the country to halt the reforms.</p>

<p>For the first few months, there was a lot of aversion and hostility, however for the following months, people became discouraged and opposed less as a result.</p>

<p>In the 1980s the socio-political decline from the 70s was continuing to show. It culminated with the Velvet Revolution. These were the bloodless events which helped to remove the Communist regime in Czechoslovakia. The initiators of this were students, as well as some actors and other well-known people. Two major movements were formed, Public Against Violence in Slovakia,  and Civic Forum in Czechia. After the police brutality on students the public protested by organising walkouts. On 27th November 1989 there was a large protest and in early December, after the resignation of communists, a new state government was created.</p>

<h2 id="poland">Poland</h2>

<p>Poland was one the most devastated countries after the Second World War, nearly 20% of the population died, including almost the whole Jewish population.
The post-war years were marred by economic depression and social unrest. Following pressure from the Soviet Union, the Communist government rejected an offer of support from the United States to rebuild the country, which was known as the Marshall plan</p>

<p>The “free election” that followed in 1947 was completely controlled by the Soviet Union and the Communist Party, which won 96% of the seats in parliament.</p>

<p>A resistant movement against the Soviet takeover of Poland emerged.
Many had poor general living conditions, such as lack of food and insufficient income that started a series of strikes and demonstrations.
In 1956, a strike among workers in Poznan developed into huge riots in which 80 people were killed.
The regime turned anti-intellectual and anti-Semitic following demonstrations in the late 1960s. This was against a backdrop of in-fighting within the Communist party and anti-Semitic sentiment as a result of the war between Israel and Egypt and the Soviet Union’s close relationship with its Arab allies. Approximately 20,000 Jews lost their jobs and had to emigrate, including many Jewish Communists.
Strikes and demonstrations broke out in Gdansk and some other cities in 1970, during which hundreds of workers were cynically shot down. Price hikes again led to strikes in many cities in 1976.
A turning point for the opposition came in 1980 when a strike at the shipyard in Gdansk forced the government to accept the creation of Solidarity (Solidarność), a free trade union under the leadership of Lech Wałęsa. Hard struggles between the free trade unions and the Communist regime took place over virtually the next ten years, including many demonstrations that ended in fatalities and mass arrests.
In 1989, after the collapse of Communism, Tadeusz Mazowiecki was elected as the first non-Communist Prime Minister  in any Soviet bloc country.</p>

<h2 id="hungarian-revolution-1956">Hungarian Revolution 1956</h2>

<p>Hungary had been controlled by Russia since 1945. The death of Stalin brought people in many Eastern European countries the hope of freedom and change, but as the 1956 uprising in Hungary proved, this was not to be the case.</p>

<h3 id="hungarian-revolution">Hungarian revolution</h3>

<p>The death of Stalin led many Hungarians to hope that Hungary also would be de-Stalinised. In July 1956, the Stalinist Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party, Rakosi, fell from power.</p>

<p>During October 1956, students, workers and soldiers in Hungary attacked the AVH (the secret police) and Russian soldiers, and smashed a statue of Stalin.</p>

<p>On 24 October 1956 Imre Nagy-a moderate- took over as prime minister.</p>

<p>Nagy asked Khrushchev to move the Russian troops out. Krushchev agreed and on 28 october 1956, the Russian army pulled out of Budapest.</p>

<p>For five days, there was freedom in Hungary. The new Hungarian government introduced democracy, freedom of speech, and freedom of religion. Cardinal Mindszenty, the leader of the Catholic Church, was freed from prison.</p>

<p>Then, on 3 November 1956, Nagy announced that Hungary was going to leave the Warsaw Pact. However, Khrushchev was not willing to allow this. He claimed he had received a letter from Hungarian Communist leaders asking for his help.</p>

<p>At  dawn on 4 November 1956, 1000 Russian tanks rolled into Budapest. They destroyed the Hungarian army and captured Hungarian Radio. The last words broadcast were „Help! Help! Help!“.</p>

<p>The Hungarian people fought the Russian troops with machine guns. Some 4000 Hungarians were killed.
Khrushchev named Russian supporter, Janos Kadar, as prime minister.</p>

<h3 id="timeline">Timeline</h3>

<p>Khrushchevs policy of de-Stalinisation caused problems in many Eastern European Communist countries, where people hated the hard-line Stalinist regimes that Russia had put in place. There was also trouble in Poland in 1956, and Khrushchev had to send in Russian troops.</p>

<ol>
<li>The Hungarians were patriotic, and they hated Russian control, especially:

<ul>
<li>The secret police called the AVH in Hungary.</li>
<li>Russian control of the economy, which had made Hungary poor.</li>
<li>Russian control of what the schools taught.</li>
<li>Censorship and lack of freedom.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Hungarians were religious, but the Communist Party had banned religion, and imprisoned Cardinal Mindszenty.</li>
<li>Hungarians thought that the United Nations or the new US president, Eisenhower, would help them.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="effects">Effects</h3>

<ol>
<li>Repression in Hungary-thousands of Hungarians were arrested and imprisoned. Some were executed and 200 000 Hungarian refugees fled to Austria.</li>
<li>Russia stayed in control behind the Iron Curtain- no other country tried to get rid of Russia troops until Czechoslovakia in 1968.</li>
<li>Polarisation of the Cold War- people in the West were horrified- many Communists left the Communist Party- and Western leaders became more determined to contain communism.</li>
</ol>
