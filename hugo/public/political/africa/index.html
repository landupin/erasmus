    <p>The USA began a policy of containment to stop the spread of communism whilst the USSR wished to spread communism throughout the world.  Decolonization in Africa and political instability in South America and SE Asia led to both superpowers trying to extend their spheres of influence in these regions. The superpowers gave money and military support which created many conflicts and civil wars throughout the globe.</p>

    <h3 id="crisis-of-the-congo">Crisis of the Congo</h3>

<p>The Congo Crisis was a period of political conflict in the Republic of Congo (today D.R. of Congo) in the timespan between 1960 – 1965. It was not only a civil war but also a proxy conflict of the Cold War, involving the Soviet Union and the UN/USA. The region was especially interesting for the two superpowers because it was very rich in natural resources such as Uranium. The Congo obtained independence from colonial rule on November 30th 1960 after an African Nationalist Movement established in the 1950’s which forced the Belgium government to resign their powers. The main figure was Patrice Lumamba, leader of the MNC (Mouvement National Congolais) that later split up. The majority stayed with Lumamba in what is now called the MNC-L. Lumamba was elected Prime Minister, a political rival, Joseph Kasa-Vobu, of the ABAKO (Alliance des Bakongo) was set as President.
However not much changed as the new government could not function without Belgian support. The former social order from colony times was in place, often due to the need of higher education or technical experience, but still causing many Congolese to riot against it. The Belgian government intervened to “protect” the white population. The ANS (Armée Nationale Congolaise) was created by Lumumba.
The mining provinces Katanga and South Kasai seceded from the national government proclaiming their independence while being supported by the Belgian government. That weakened Lumumba’s government who called for the UN and the United States for support. The UN sent peacekeeping troops along with the withdrawal of all Belgian troops from the Congo. Lumumba hoped the ONUC (United Nations Organization in the Congo) would help him suppress the secessionist states but it was seen as an internal conflict. Lumumba called for the Soviet Union who immediately sent military advisors, weapons and material support and South Kasai was successfully attacked. His actions were not supported by Kasa-Vobu as he feared Soviet takeover. A conflict between Kasa-Vobu and Lumumba started, were both tried to dismiss the other from their powers. Joseph-Désiré Mobutu launched a coup, and later sided with Kasa-Vobu. Lumubu tried to escape but was captured. Later he was tortured and executed in Katanga which led to international outrage. Also, it was followed by counter execution of political prisoners.
South Kasai was overrun by the ANS troops. The UN secretary general Dag Hammarskjöld died in a plane crash, his successor U Thant pursued a more radical plan including the support of the national government. (Resolution 169) The UN troops forced the end of the Katangese secession.
Congo tried to reform their political system with renaming their country “Democratic Republic of the Congo” and establishing a new constitution in June 1964. Kasa-Vabu appointed Tshombe, the exiled Katangese leader, as interim Prime Minister but the rebellion broke out before the scheduled election. The Simba and Kwilu rebels were supported by the Soviet Union and China. The rebellion was pushed back months later by the ANS together with UN troops and soon dissolved completely. The country was not able to reform a functioning political system resulting in Mobutu taking over the control in his second coup d`état. He was supported by the USA and many other Western government because it promised economic and political stability. Mobutu established a dictatorship lasting till 1997 and renamed the country Zaire in 1971.</p>

<h3 id="egypt">Egypt</h3>

<p>Egypt had been a protectorate of Britain and France.  The Soviets poured masses of aid into Egypt and persuaded the Government to nationalise the Suez canal. For a while the British were prepared to escalate a minor conflict but were wary of such escalation and backed down, allowing Egypt to fall under a Soviet sphere of influence for a time.</p>

<h3 id="imperialism-decolonization">Imperialism – Decolonization</h3>

<p>At the end of  World War II Africa was still part of European colonial empires.Counties such as Great Britain,France,Belgium or Portugal were the main powers together with Ottoman African empires but this was abolished after the WWI. After  WWI the fact that colonialism for Britain,France and Belgium was no longer possible was more than evident.Those two world wars had cost european nations a lot of economic loss and in terms of manpower important resources for maintaining a colonial empire.Furthermore,independence movements in the Middle East and India picked up momentum and by the end of 1950’s most of these countries became independent. Referring to British,French and Belgium Africa,the decolonization process happened very quickly over the period of fifties to sixties.These former colonies now had independence and resources that they hoped to sell to solidify their place in the global economy.Naturally the USSR and the USA had interests in these African nations.</p>

<h3 id="angolan-civil-war">Angolan civil war</h3>

<p>The Angolan Civil War was a major civil conflict in Angola, beginning in 1975. The war started immediately after Angola became independent from Portugal. The civil war was essentially a power struggle between two former liberation movement - The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and the People&rsquo;s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). The result was a victory of MPLA.  The war served as a surrogate battleground for the Cold War. It involved deaths of over 500000 both soldiers and civilians. The combined forces of MPLA, FNLA and UNITA created a transitional government with the Alvor Accord of 1974. After this civil war, which lasted for 14 years, an agreement of truce was signed.</p>

<p>Pan Africanism
Pan-Africanism in an ideopolitical concept based on unity and belonging to one race. It concerns mainly Africa, North America and the Caribbean countries. The beginnings of this movement date back to the 19th century. The most influential man in the history of Pan-Africanism is Kwame Nkrumah. Supporters believe that unity is necessary for political, economic and social progress and that the fate of all African people is intertwined. The development of Pan-Africanism resulted in the establishment of the Organization of African Unity in 1963.
The main principles of Pan-Africanism are:
1. Africa needs to get rid of foreign domination – independence of Africa
2. Africa has to unite in effort to solve all problems – the unity of Africa
3. Africa needs to be radically reorganized – transformation of Africa
4. Africa must return to authentic sources – specificity of Africa</p>

<h3 id="operation-condor">Operation Condor</h3>

<p>Mass murder in Latin America began as an operation called Condor. In the background of Operation Condor were the US, which supported dictators all over Latin America.
The United States wanted to suppress all movements that opposed their interests to prevent the formation of socialist regimes in Latin America. The US funded this brutal terror, trained agents and security services of Latin American right-wing dictatorships. Operation Condor was officially launched in 1968 and lasted until 1989. With the help of the United States, takeovers were phased out in Paraguay, Brazil, Bolivia, Uruguay, Chile, and Argentina. According to estimates, more than 50,000 people were killed during the Condor operation in these countries. Among the victims were most communists, socialists, left-wingers of all shades, sedentary and trade unionists and activists, students, intellectuals, teachers, left-wing partisans, but also nuns and priests.</p>

<ul>
<li>There were a lot of inner problems in the dominant group.</li>
<li>The opposition of the guerrilla warfare, the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN). FSLN was founded in 1962 to fight against the dictatorship of the Somoza dynasty and in defense of a socialist government. They also opposed American interventionism in the area.</li>
</ul>

<p>In spite of the problems between the different factions in the movement, the rapid growth of
the popular raisings forced the FSLN to get in charge of the revolution which supplanted the
power of Somoza in July, 1979.
The government led by the Sandinistas (Daniel Ortega) took good measures, for example the
agricultural reform which increased the agriculture for own consume and to exportation. But
there were several problems, like the opposition of UNO (Unión Nacional Opositora) 14 the
that made the Sandinistas be removed from power in 1990.</p>

In 1955 he met Fidel Castro, who convinced him to participate in a guerilla attack on Cuba with the goal to overthrow the government. The revolution had success and he became president of the national bank and industrial minister of Cuba.
In the following years Guevara tried to realize his radical ideas in Cuba which led to conflicts with Fidel Castro. Due to the conflicts with Castro he retired from all his political posts and went to the Congo to support the revolution there. But it failed miserably and he went to  Bolivia in 1966 to support the communist party there. His armed group of revolutionaries was beaten and he was captured in a battle with the government military in 1967. After this he was sentenced to death and was shot at the same day.</p>

<h3 id="civil-military-dictatorship-of-uruguay">Civil – military dictatorship of Uruguay</h3>

<p>The civil-military dictatorship of Uruguay (1973–85), also known as the Uruguayan Dictatorship, was an authoritarian military dictatorship that ruled Uruguay for over ten years, from June 27 1973 until February 28 1985. The dictatorship has been the subject of much controversy due to its violations of human rights, use of torture, and the unexplained disappearances of many Uruguayans. The term &ldquo;civic-military&rdquo; refers to the military regime&rsquo;s initial use of a relatively powerless civilian president as the head of state, which distinguished it from dictatorships in other South American countries in which senior military officers immediately seized power and directly served as head of state. The dictatorship was the culmination of an escalation of violence and authoritarianism in a traditionally peaceful and democratic country, and exist within the context of other military dictatorship in the region. It resulted in the suppression of all former political activity, including the traditional political parties. Many people were imprisoned and tortured, especially members of the Left.</p>

<h3 id="the-revolutionary-coordinating-junta">The revolutionary coordinating Junta</h3>

<p>The Revolutionary Coordinating Junta was an alliance of leftist organizations in South America. The JCR arose in the middle of 1970s and was composed of the Chilean Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR), the Argentine People&rsquo;s Revolutionary Army (ERP), the Uruguayan Tupamaros, and the Bolivian National Liberation Army (ELN).
JCR was formed by MIR, which was considered as a revolutionary party and advocated a Marxist-Leninist model of revolution. MIR built up small arsenals of light arms and Before 1973, the organization may have staged few attacks and it tried  to infiltrate the Chilean Armed Forces.
The ERP was founded as a communist party, but soon turned  into the Cultural Revolution.The ERP began function  in 1969 and the leader was  Juan Carlos Onganía. It was  using violent campaign and methods  such as assassinations and kidnappings of government officials and foreign company executives. However most kidnappings ended in the death of the hostage. The ERP occupied 52 towns, robbed 166 banks and took US $76 million in ransoms for the kidnappings of 185 people.
ELN was formed by Che Guevara and it was a Marxist-Leninist guerrilla organization that operated in Bolivia during the 1960s and 1970s. It  supported Fidel Castro&rsquo;s government in Cuba. Despite of  common goals these organizations the JCR never achieved real effectiveness.</p>

<h3 id="sovereignty-of-puerto-rico">Sovereignty of Puerto Rico</h3>

<p>During the Cold War, Latin America was a strategic defensive pillar between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union gained more influence there after the Cuban Revolution, and they transferred their nuclear warheads to Cuba. Afterwards, the USA joined the Dirty War. From political point of view, Puerto Rico belonged to the United States and  from the cultural point of view, it belonged to the Latin America. United States allowed to enact their local Constitution, but Puerto Ricans could not use their sovereignty to remove the application of the Territorial Clause of the USA.  The United States Army maintained the status quo, because United States do not want to lose their presence in Caribbean.  A situation further complicated by the emergence of Marxist guerrillas, including the Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional Puertorriqueña and Boricua Popular Army, within the pre-existing independence movement in Puerto Rico. The status issue stagnated throughout the remainder of the Cold War. Eventually, it led to the current incarnation of the free association movement in Puerto Rico.</p>
