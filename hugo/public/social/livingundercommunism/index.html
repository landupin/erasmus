    <p>These cruel times occurred right after the Second World War and gradually spread into the countries which were controlled by USSR. It immediately affected people&#39;s lives in many ways such as economic, cultural or religious. However, the worst thing of this regime was the lack of freedom in everyday life.</p>

<p>Those who did not comply with socialism were not only interrogated, intimidated and put under surveillance but also subject to house searches, during which the Secret Police invaded citizens’ privacy while searching for illegal literature. Bribes abounded; the presence of bugs in homes prevented people from speaking openly; there were long lines at the shops; people were imprisoned for filing complaints or signing petitions. Furthermore, the rich turned poor as owners of extravagant housing were given new accommodation in the country. Tradesmen were chosen to head companies. Members of the intelligentsia were forced to do menial jobs such as cleaning streets or washing windows. If a citizen defected, the family left behind was severely punished. People socializing with dissidents were interrogated and accused of subversion.</p>

<p>Children brought up in non-communist families were not given the right to the education that children of conformists following the regime were given. They were not given the chance of rising to positions of responsibility or authority.</p>

<p>When trying to leave the GDR, a ransom would have to had been paid for each person. This was because the regime required money to buy better surveillance equipment. Telephone calls, letters and any other forms of long-distance communication were always being monitored by the state.</p>

<p>Surveillance was everywhere in East Germany during the Cold War and citizens were often forced to live two different lifestyles. What they said and did at home was one thing, but they had to be careful when speaking publicly at school or work.</p>

<p>Despite essentials for life being cheap (i.e. bread, water), salaries were low and many things we take for granted today were seen as luxuries due to being insanely expensive. Unemployment was almost non-existent as work was found for every man and woman in East Germany.</p>

<p>As soon as the regime had collapsed, many requested Stasi files to see what the government had picked up on whilst spying on citizens. Many citizens were very much isolated from Western culture, for example, many children may have grown up not knowing what a Barbie doll was.</p>

<h3 id="life-under-communism-in-czechoslovakia">Life Under Communism in Czechoslovakia</h3>

<p>The state was controlling the economy which was working very poorly, as basic citizens supplies were often not to be found. Many foods such as coconuts and mandarins were seen as luxuries, and therefore were only present at times like Christmas. Criticizing the state, of course, meant that you would be disadvantaged by the state in many ways. Children would not be accepted into universities, companies could decide not to offer people jobs, and so on. There were thousands of police members working undercover to listen in on conversations of daily life and often random people were paid to report any news to government officials. Not being employed at the time was a crime. Work was found for everyone of all classes and there was no unemployment. Of course, living in a communist country, everyone worked for the government in some way or another. Life was very similar to that of the control in East Germany, however, it can be noted that surveillance and border control was less prominent in Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p>The Communist era marked the end of the Sokol organization – sokol means falcon – which had displayed a strong democratic tradition as far back as the 19th century. After 1948 the Spartakiáda festivals, held every five years, took its place. In these sport shows thousands of gymnasts performed choreographed feats, emphasizing the importance of the group over the individual.</p>

<h2 id="public-life">Public life</h2>

<p>The nature of the regimes required outward agreement and loyalty from their citizens, so those who wanted to live without trouble from the state had to create and maintain a stark divide between their public lives, in which they displayed obedience and deference to the government&rsquo;s demands, and their private lives, where they could speak more freely.</p>

<p>While many talked openly at home about political and social issues, in public it was necessary to use official and conformist language. This was not only the case in the world of adults, but also for children, who at school in particular were confronted with the official, propaganda-defined version of reality</p>

<p>Invasion of privacy was one of the repressive strategies of the State Security apparatus. Extortion and pressure via family members was sometimes more effective than directly persecuting the opponents of the regime. Police harassment was hard to bear without familial trust and strong emotional ties.</p>

<h2 id="educational-system">Educational system</h2>

<p>Communist ideology permeated the politically-based education system. Students had to study subjects such as Marxism-Leninism. They learned by rote, not encouraged to discuss issues or form their own opinions. Applicants were accepted into university if they had working class backgrounds, supported the Communist regime and had participated in Communist youth organizations.</p>

<h2 id="pioneers">Pioneers</h2>

<p>The Pioneer Organization of the Czechoslovak Youth Union was formed on April 24, 1949. It brought together almost all children from 6 to 15 years under the auspices of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. The goal of the pioneer organization was to ideologically act on the youth and to fulfill its free time.</p>

<p>Children between the ages of 6 and 8 were among the group so called “Iskričky” and wore a badge and a white shirt. Pioneers aged between 8 and 15 wore a white shirt with a pioneer badge and a red scarf on the neck. Boys would wear light blue trousers with a belt with a metal buckle with a symbol of pioneers on it. A uniform was worn on official occasions.</p>

<p>The free time of the pioneers was organized, especially during the summer months by the so called children&rsquo;s pioneer camps. International pioneer camps were also organized in the Soviet Union, Hungary or Poland. At schools, children regularly attended pioneer class meetings and class events (visits to museums, exhibitions, trips, castles, monuments and memorials of victims of the Second World War). For pioneers there were many opportunities for developing their hobbies (technical, natural sciences, reading, arts, sports) organized in schools. Pioneer actions included part-time jobs, collection of secondary materials, collection of garbage through cities and others. Compulsory membership in socialist youth organizations ended this revolution in 1989.</p>

<h2 id="culture-and-media">Culture and media</h2>

<p>Authors whose writings did not conform to socialism found their works banned, and other artists, such as actors and directors, were not permitted to take part in productions.</p>

<p>Also controlled by the government, the media were a mouthpiece for the Communist regime. Censorship became law and television, for example, was full of official optimism, Tractors and factories often appeared on the screen as symbols of working class successes. Editorials were riddled with clichés, and platitudes abounded. During the normalization purges of 1969-70, dozens of magazines and journals were shut down.</p>

<h2 id="the-glorification-of-the-worker">The glorification of the worker</h2>

<p>Under Communism workers were worshipped as heroes and exploited as propaganda for the regime. Miners, for example, received excellent pensions and comfortable housing. Workers had better salaries than university professors. The working-class employees who obeyed Communist doctrine were rewarded with holidays abroad – in Bulgaria, Romania, the Soviet Union or Yugoslavia rather than in the West.</p>

<h2 id="agriculture">Agriculture</h2>

<p>Farmers, especially wealthy ones referred to as “kulaks,” were enemies of the Communist regime. During the years of Stalinization, farms were nationalized in what was called collectivization. No one could own more than 50 hectares of land. While the lives of richer farmers were destroyed, poorer peasants were excited by the system. Communists blackmailed farmers and threatened them with imprisonment if they did not join cooperatives. Such farmers were publicly denounced and found themselves without supplies. Greedy farmers took positions on committees setting up the cooperatives and were rewarded by vacations abroad, the cooperative paying all expenses. Yet collectivization was inefficient and failed.</p>

<h2 id="religion">Religion</h2>

<p>Still, farmers were not the Communist Party’s greatest rival – religion was.  People protested by setting up an underground movement of clergy and lay people from various denominations. The Communists took over Church property, closing down all 216 monasteries in Czechoslovakia during 1950 and most of the 339 convents. Some clergymen were murdered, while others found themselves sharing prison cells with murderers or the insane, or they were sent to labour camps or placed in the army. In 1950 the secret police planted weapons in a monastery and carried out a show trial accusing Catholic priests of spying. The ordained spent many years in prison.</p>

<h2 id="freedom-of-movement">Freedom of movement</h2>

<p>Emigration and any travel abroad were not allowed without an explicit permission from the government. People who were not allowed to leave the country and campaigned for their right to leave in the 1970s were known as <em>&ldquo;refuseniks&rdquo;</em>. According to the Soviet Criminal Code, a refusal to return from abroad was treason, punishable by imprisonment for a term of 10–15 years, or death with confiscation of property.
Travel to <em>closed cities</em> and to the regions near USSR state borders was strongly restricted. An attempt to illegally escape abroad was punishable by imprisonment for 1–3 years.</p>

<h2 id="punishments">Punishments</h2>

<p>Large and public acts of resistance were prevented and often brutally punished. The dissidents were often arrested or exiled in response for taking part in dissent. To the regimes, such responses were a matter of necessity — leaving the dissidents in peace would have given them the chance to share their ideas with a greater segment of the population, which was not a risk they were willing to take.</p>

<h2 id="women-s-rights-in-communist-countries">Women’s rights in Communist countries</h2>

<p>In the time of the Cold War, particularly the earlier years, many women in America and Western Europe were still trapped within rigidly traditional gender roles. They were often housewives and spent their time cooking, cleaning and looking after their children, they very rarely worked.  The situation in communist countries was often different. Although women still did the lions share of domestic duties, mostly due to societal attitudes rather than government policy, they were also introduced into the mainstream labour force and their professional aspirations and public roles often changed greatly in newly communist states such as the GDR. In 1980s East Germany for example around 50% of the labour force was female, whereas the US labour force had still only reached 47% by the year 2000, nearly 20 years later. Some people regard the “emancipation” of women in Communist countries as being an important step towards equality, whereas others see it as simply adding the burden of work onto women, in addition to more traditional duties, without changing the way in which work was structured in the home.</p>

<p>Despite the integration of women into the workforce there were also Eastern Bloc policies that many would consider an affront to women’s equality and rights. In Romania in October 1966 Decree 770 was authorized by the then leader Nicolae Ceaușescu. This made abortion and contraception illegal for all women, excepting those who met certain specific criteria, in an effort to boost Romania’s population. This effectively prevented women from controlling their own pregnancies and resulted in a childbed mortality rate more than ten times the levels of Romania’s neighbours. It is important to note that the issue of abortion and contraception is specific to Romania.</p>

<h2 id="buying-and-selling-under-communism">Buying and Selling under Communism</h2>

<p>It would not have been possible in a communist country to simply open a car dealership and begin selling cars. Therefore, it was not possible to simply walk into one and buy a car. The system for the distribution of material goods (such as vehicles) was actually relatively complex and controlled by the government.</p>

<p>Communist countries produced less goods than their populations desired. Unlike capitalism, however, where demand is controlled by the price of the product (i.e. a more expensive product means less people can afford to buy it) the demand for goods in communist countries was virtually impossible to regulate, since everybody earned roughly equivalent wages. Demand, therefore, was usually much higher than the supply and there were mass shortages of many consumer goods, this meant that people had to apply to the government to own high value items such as cars and the chances of getting one were very slim. The average waiting time for a Soviet made Lada could be upwards of ten years.
There were exceptions. Members of the nomenklatura- the communist party leaders and elites in Soviet Russia, were granted access to special stores which sold soviet made as well as imported goods which were simply not available to ordinary Russians.</p>
