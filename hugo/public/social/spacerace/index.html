    <p>The Space Race was a competition between the United States and the Soviet Union during the time of the Cold War to be the first country to go into space. In this “proxy war” the Soviet Union started off better than the US by sending the first satellite, Sputnik 1 (1957), and the first cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin into space (1961). The US reacted by boosting NASA with money to land the first man on the moon, which happened in 1969. After that the USSR and USA did not compete with each other anymore in this field and until today they are working rather closely together in space.</p>

    <p>During the time of the Cold War the USSR and USA competed in every possible way for example in the Space Race. The USSR had a head start with the launch of the first satellite Sputnik 1 in 1957; this was followed by sending the first creature (Laika, a dog) into space.</p>

<p>However the dog died two hours after launch.
The USA only experienced failures until their first successful launch of Explorer 1 in 1958, shortly after the establishment of NASA. Two years later the USSR had an accident with a fuel tank killing 126 people. In spite of this, they sent the first man, Yuri Gagarin, into space one year later in 1960.</p>

<p>The Soviets tried to hide the death of a cosmonaut who burnt alive in a testing cabin in the same year. Soon after this, America sent their first man, Alan Shepard, into space.
The Soviets extended their lead by sending a probe, which flew past Venus, a year before the US had done it. On May 25 1961, US President Kennedy ordered establishment of the Apollo programme in order to land a man on the moon within a decade. In this time, an American rocket was carrying nuclear warheads in order to attack the USSR at any time.
The first woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova, was sent by the Soviets in 1963, shortly before they launched the first spacecraft with more than one passenger.</p>

<p>In 1964, the new Soviet leader Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev cancelled all space missions to focus on the moon landing. The Soviet space programme reached its peak with the first man entering free space in 1965. The first Apollo mission failed as the three astronauts suffocated in the capsule when testing it. In the crash of Soyuz 1, the USSR lost their lead in the Space Race because they spent 18 months repairing it. The US began a chain of successful events starting with the first ever pictures of earth taken from a spacecraft. The next Apollo mission had a livestream of the Earth and Moon with millions of people watching it.</p>

<p>Finally, the most remarkable event in space history occurred when Apollo 11 was successfully carried out. On July 20 1969, Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong were the first people to step on the moon’s surface.Neil Armstrong described the event as &ldquo;one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.&rdquo;
The American mission Apollo 11 can be considered the end of the Space Race.</p>

<p>To conclude, one can say that the USSR had a head start in the Space Race with their successes such as Sputnik 1 and Yuri Gagarin but as the years passed, the USA caught up and ended the race with their remarkable moon landing. Today, the USA and Russia work together to make progress in the technology and science of space. As of now, a German, a Russian and an American woman are working together in the International Space Station (ISS).</p>
