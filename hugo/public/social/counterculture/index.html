    <p>The counterculture of the 1960s refers to an anti-establishment cultural phenomenon that was first developed in the US as a response to previous generations’ old religious and social standards. They opened up questions about sexuality, women&#39;s rights, respecting authorities and experimenting with drugs. The movement also protested against war in Vietnam and war in general.</p>

    <p>Vietnam became important to the Eastern and western blocs, the east wanted to win more communist satellite states and the west feared a communist revolt. The US supported South Vietnam with equipment and advise. This proxy war, which was typical of the Cold War, became almost like a conflict between the Soviet Union and US. Images and news from the war, for example the “Napalm Girl”, could now be seen on televisions across the world, they shocked people and many became opposed to what was happening. The divide between supporters and opponents of the Vietnam War was an important factor contributing to the rise of the counterculture movement. The movement began as an anti-war culture which then grew into the “hippy movement”, a desire for peace.</p>

<p>The Beat Generation was an important influence on the hippies. Beat movement (also called Beat Generation) was an American social and literary movement originating in the 1950s and centred in the bohemian artist communities of San Francisco’s North Beach, Los Angeles’ Venice West, and New York City’s Greenwich Village.</p>

<p>Hippy movement became a global peace movement influenced by music such as Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix and the Beatles after their long stay in India. Culminating in Woodstock, NY, the biggest music festival to date, where hippies traveled from all over the US for the “summer of love”. This built on the anti-Vietnam movement which had had a huge rally in Washington in October 67.</p>

<p>Although it may be thought that the counterculture took place mainly in the west, the east also had its own movement. For the Soviet Union the 60s was seen as a period of stagnation, counterculture especially took off in large cities such as Moscow and Kiev. In Czechoslovakia hippies were known as ‘Mánička’. Hippies were socially ostracised and harassed, considered anti-soviet units. This resulted in liberalisation in the Prague Spring.</p>

<p>Similarly, in Germany, a tradition started in 1958 in which people marched for peace, continuing to this day. The protestors original concerns were anti-nuclear and anti-Vietnam but have grown to include a campaign for peace in a wider sense. In Spain student protests were mainly focused on opposition to General Franco. Spanish song writers began to write more protest songs influenced by western pop culture</p>

<p>In the Moscow protocol many reforms of Czechoslovakia were reversed, such as the freedom of press and the freedom of assembling. Social change took much longer in the east than in the west. Some believe that the reason the counterculture slowed pace may be because the generation of young supporters were now grown up and less rebellious.</p>

<p>In the UK the campaign for nuclear disarmament (CND) grew out of the church movement and campaigned for britain to disarm nuclear weapons. They gained a lot of popular support and were heavily influential on the Greenham Common Women’s Peace Camp, where women campaigned outside the RAF base to remove nuclear weapons. The conservative right viewed such protesters as playing into the communists hands, whereas campaigners for peace viewed them as champions of peace.</p>
