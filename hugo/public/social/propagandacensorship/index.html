    <p>Propaganda and censorship during the Cold War represented key tools for both the United States of America and the Soviet Union in perpetuating their ideologies to the world. Both countries were ready to defend their military and economic interests. During that time, the media was centralised in the east, which meant that it was very easy to control, unlike nowadays. A prolonged state of fear was enforced through media, which maintained the antagonistic state of the Cold War.</p>

<p>During the Cold War the United States as well as the Soviet Union tried to influence their people in believing in their current system and defame the enemy´s system. Especially in the USSR, which was a dictatorship, the state censored system-critical writings because they feared the people would question the political system. System-critical writers and were seen as a danger and were persecuted, imprisoned or worse. People in the USSR were isolated from the rest of the world and the state tried to keep it that way at all costs.
In almost every parts of their everyday life, people in the USSR and US were confronted with Propaganda. For example: posters and banners on the streets (more likely to be found in the USSR), in newspapers, radio, television, theatre and movies but also education.
From young childhood kids are influenced in believing that the enemy´s system is bad. “Anti-commie” shows like the american tv-show Make Mine Freedom want to show what advantages the US has in comparison to a communist state. Even the well known Marvel Comics persuaded an anti communist goal in the 50´s. In one of those comics for example, Captain America fights off red spies and the hero Submariner fights Soviet submarines.
In the USSR, kids were mostly influenced with communist propaganda in school and youth organizations like the Young Pioneers where they were taught to be truthful and uncompromising and to fight the enemies of socialism.They were explicitly told that they were to build a utopia of brotherhood and justice. Being confronted with propaganda at such young age is like getting brainwashed.
Movies were heavily propagandistic because it was a perfect way to influence people with something they are entertained by. The enemy stereotype of Soviet Russia could easily be conveyed. Especially in Hollywood films on the cold war were extremely popular. For example Invasion U.S.A (1952); Red Nightmare (1962); From Russia with Love (1963) and also Rocky IV (1982) is about the conflict between the US and USSR.
In conclusion and in summary one can say that the US and USSR tried to influence their own people in believing their system is best possible system and tried to defame their enemy´s system with propaganda in the media and society.</p>
