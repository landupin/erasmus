    <p>From 1955-1975, a ‘Cold War-era Proxy war’ took part between North Vietnam who invaded South Vietnam; to expand their communist ideology and were supported by the Soviet Union and China. However, due to USAs Communism Containment Policy, South Vietnam received American much support, but in 1975 America withdrew all troops as defeat was inevitable.</p>

    <p>The Cold War is often considered the golden age of espionage, a time when the United States and Soviet Union used all available tools to uncover each other’s secrets by operating with great secrecy and living double lives so they could infiltrate enemy governments. They certainly spent large amounts of money recruiting, training and  utfitting spies and agents. The purpose of espionage was to collect information about the enemy, their army and technical abilities, their actions and intentions.</p>

<h2 id="literature-and-movies">Literature and movies</h2>

<p>The topic of Espionage and especially the matter of spies and secret agents during the Cold War is often adopted in literature and various movies. Probably the most popular and iconic spy movie series is the James Bond series with many movies for example <em>“From Russia with love”</em> (1963) <em>“Goldfinger”</em> (1964) which have a direct connection to the topic of Espionage and Cold War. In fact, there are 16 James Bond movies which where published in the time of the Cold war.
Besides this famous movie series there are many other more recent published movies with a similar topic for example the thriller “Bridge of Spies” (2015) or the more humorous “The man from U.N.C.L.E.” (2015).
The wide variety of movies shows how fascinated people are still today by this topic. And there are not just movies which cover the topic of the Cold War, there are also lots of books, for example the book series from Ian Fleming about James Bond which was an inspiration for the eponymous movies.
Besides these more entertaining examples there are of course many informing and historically correct documentaries and books which teach you something about how the live of a spy during the Cold War really was. Because in the big Hollywood movies which are very popular the life of a spy is often excessively action packed and exciting.</p>

<p>So to conclude you could say that the topic of espionage during the Cold War is oftentimes covered in Literature and movies of any kind and genre and still today there is a big interest into this topic so the production of literature and movies to this topic will not stop soon.</p>

<p>Married in 1939, they lived in the New York City. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were devoted communists who headed a spy ring that passed military secrets to the Soviets. The scheme got underway sometime after 1940, when Julius became a civilian engineer with the U.S. Army Signal Corps. He was dismissed in 1945 once the military learned of his communist sympathies, but not before recruiting Ethel’s brother, an Army machinist working on the Manhattan Project, to turn over handwritten notes and sketches pertaining to the atomic bomb. Meanwhile, other Rosenberg recruits purportedly delivered thousands of pages of documents detailing new radar and aircraft technologies. At trial following their 1950 arrest, Ethel’s brother testified against them, and a judge sentenced them to death, declaring their crime “worse than murder.”</p>

<p>President Dwight D. Eisenhower then sealed their fate by denying a petition for executive clemency. The two were sent to the electric chair at New York State’s Sing Sing prison on June 19, 1953, marking the first time American civilians had ever been executed for espionage. Although worldwide protests erupted over the Rosenbergs’ treatment, with many people feeling they had fallen victim to McCarthy-era red baiting, the post-Soviet release of decrypted KGB messages proved that Julius had in fact been a spy. The evidence against Ethel is less ironclad, and her guilt remains in dispute.</p>

<p>Following Adolf Hitler’s rise to power in 1933, Klaus Fuchs fled his native Germany for the United Kingdom, where he received a doctorate in physics and eventually became a citizen. During World War II he was invited to join Britain’s clandestine atomic bomb development program, despite his known communist leanings, and from there was sent to the United States to take part in the Manhattan Project. Upon returning to the U.K., Fuchs secured a prestigious post at a nuclear energy research center. In 1950, however, he was apprehended after U.S. agents discovered that for years he had been handing nuclear secrets to the Soviets, who by now had their own atomic bomb. Fuch confessed, telling the authorities that he “had complete confidence in Russian policy” and that “the Western Allies deliberately allowed Russia and Germany to fight each other to the death.” Though Fuchs claimed not to know his American contact’s true name, the FBI quickly traced a trail back to the Rosenberg spy ring, resulting in the arrest of the Rosenbergs and several co-conspirators. Compared to the Rosenbergs, Fuchs got off easy. After nine years in British prison, he immigrated to East Germany, where he continued working as a nuclear physicist until his retirement in 1979. A winner of the Karl Marx Medal, East Germany’s highest civilian honor, Fuchs died in 1988 at age 76.</p>
