      <description>During the Cold War, information was a key commodity. It was vital to know what the adversary was up to, as the possibility of using the hi-tech surveillance that is used today was not around, yet. Instead of trusting technology they relied on spies: people who infiltrated enemy territory and tried to discover information while staying undetected. Soviet espionage in the United States during the Cold War was a continuation and further development of World War II nuclear espionage, and Cold Warespionage was depicted in works such as “James Bond” and “Matt Helm” booksand movies.</description>

Images and news from the war, for example the “Napalm Girl”, could now be seen on televisions across the world, they shocked people and many became opposed to what was happening.</description>

      <description>Culture in the Eastern spheres of Europe was often under strict governmental control. Pro-communist ideals were encouraged and anti-communist ideals were suppressed. This divide was most evident in Soviet-sphere music. In the USSR for example, the government encouraged the population to listen to traditional Russian Folk music, such as the song Katuschka which was covered by several different artists in many different languages. It eventually became one of the most famous communist partisan anthems along with “Bella Ciao”.</description>

      <description>The fact that religion played a significant role in the Cold War might seem self-evident, given the atheistic nature of communism and the powerful influence of Christianity on the lives of millions of people on both sides of the Iron Curtain - no doubt that the governments of communist countries saw Christianity as a threat and responded accordingly. After World War II, the Catholic Church, aided by the CIA, persuaded the Italian electorate to vote for anti-communist parties, thus preventing the most popular party, the communist, from taking the power in Italy.</description>

      <description>During the time of the Cold War the USSR and USA competed in every possible way for example in the Space Race. The USSR had a head start with the launch of the first satellite Sputnik 1 in 1957; this was followed by sending the first creature (Laika, a dog) into space.
However the dog died two hours after launch. The USA only experienced failures until their first successful launch of Explorer 1 in 1958, shortly after the establishment of NASA.</description>

      <description>The Chess Championships of 1972 A notable occasion in the history of Cold War sports were the momentous Chess Championships of 1972. This event was a perfect example of the superpower rivalry, and has even been referred to as the ‘Match of the Century’. Sports during the Cold War were not only a test of strength, but of mind, and chess was the ultimate test of intelligence. What was especially interesting about these championships was the match between the USA and USSR, or more specifically, between challenger Bobby Fischer, and defending champion Boris Spassky.</description>
