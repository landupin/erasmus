    <p>Countries under totalitarianism wanted freedom and because of that there were revolutions which caused the fall of the socialist political system. Communist ideology did not tolerate opinion of plurality or democracy. All political and economic spheres were conformed to communist ideology. Political power was gained over the people step by step, constantly denying basic human rights and liberties. Due to this, effort was growing for defense of human rights against communist totalitarian power in the 1950s.Lack of freedom was not exclusive to the Eastern bloc during the Cold War. Despite being geographically located in the democratic West, Spain was under General Franco’s fascist regime, where human rights were severely restricted. If you want to learn more about this time in Spanish history, please watch the interviews to witnesses of that era.</p>

<h2 id="the-right-to-your-own-opinion">The right to your own opinion</h2>

<p>When a person expressed his/her opinion and it was not identical with the opinion of the communist regime,the person could be pursued, put in prison or he/she was kicked out from his job.</p>

<h2 id="freedom-of-religion">Freedom of Religion</h2>

<p>Communists were atheists, so people who were believers had a lot of disadvantages. For example it was harder for them to go to university, or priest could not work for their parish, all religious orders were forbidden etc…</p>

<h2 id="restriction-of-culture">Restriction of culture</h2>

<p>Communists regulated culture a lot. These restrictions also limited the performances of artists. Communists set rules about what kind of tv shows and theater plays are right for public display. A lot of singers were not allowed to perform such as Karel Kryl, Marta Kubišová and more. Socialist realism affected the whole culture including literature, art and architecture.</p>

<h2 id="the-right-to-travel">The right to travel</h2>

<p>People could travel, but only to the countries which were part of the Soviet bloc. When family wanted to go on vacation elsewhere, they had to go to a commission to get permission. But one family member had to stay at home because communists wanted to be sure, that they would return .</p>

<h2 id="the-right-to-vote">The right to vote</h2>

<p>Voting was an obligation for everyone. The totalitarian regime bragged about with the large number of voters, which often exceeded 99% . However, voting was just some formal event, because the winning party was known before the voting. Voting was secret just in theory, those who were so brave and went behind the screen to vote, aroused suspicion.</p>

<h2 id="assembly">Assembly</h2>

<p>People couldn&#39;t form civic associations, because they could be suspected of plotting against the government. The communist police also received gossip about the formation of groups of people. This police had spies everywhere and people did not even know about them.</p>
